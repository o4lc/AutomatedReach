This repository constains the code for [Automated Reachability Analysis of Neural Network-Controlled Systems via Adaptive Polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07553). This framework is a branch and bound based method for neural network reachability analysis using DeepPoly introduced by Taha Entesari and Mahyar Fazlyab. This work will be presented at L4DC 2023.
