This repository constains the code for [Automated Reachability Analysis of Neural Network-Controlled Systems via Adaptive Polytopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07553). This framework is a branch and bound based method for neural network reachability analysis using DeepPoly introduced by Taha Entesari and Mahyar Fazlyab. This work will be presented at L4DC 2023.

The code uses DeepPoly for the bounding routine. To install this, you first need to follow through the installation process of mn_bab [https://github.com/eth-sri/mn-bab](https://github.com/eth-sri/mn-bab).
